ClodHopper: A High Performance Java Library for Data Clustering
===============================================================

MISSION STATEMENT:

ClodHopper is a open source Java library for high-performance clustering of numerical data.  
It contains clustering implementations such as K-Means, K-Means++, X-Means, G-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, 
and various forms of hierarchical clustering. ClodHopper's clustering implementations take advantage 
of the host system's concurrent processing ability in order to speed up clustering. The data 
structures are also very lean in order to conserve on memory usage.  ClodHopper is also 
very extensible.  If you are developing a new clustering algorithm, you may save yourself an 
enormous amount of work by extending a ClodHopper base class.
