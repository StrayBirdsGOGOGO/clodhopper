ClodHopper: A High Performance Java Library for Data Clustering
===============================================================

MISSION STATEMENT:
------------------

ClodHopper is a open source Java library for high-performance clustering of numerical data.  
It contains clustering implementations such as K-Means, K-Means++, X-Means, G-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, 
and various forms of hierarchical clustering. ClodHopper's clustering implementations take advantage 
of the host system's concurrent processing ability in order to speed up clustering. The data 
structures are also very lean in order to conserve on memory usage.  ClodHopper is also 
very extensible.  If you are developing a new clustering algorithm, you may save yourself an 
enormous amount of work by extending a ClodHopper base class.

How to get started with ClodHopper:
-----------------------------------

1. If you want to download and browse the code, use git as follows:

	> `git clone https://github.com/rscarberry-wa/clodhopper.git`
	
In the newly-created clodhopper directory, you will find the subdirectories
clodhopper-core and clodhopper_examples.  The first contains a maven project for
clodhopper proper.  The second contains a project of numerous examples. 
I recommend importing both projects into eclipse or the IDE of your choice.

2.  If you simply want to use ClodHopper to cluster something in one of your programs, just place this
dependency into your maven `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.battelle</groupId>
  <artifactId>clodhopper-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
	
3. The simplest example shows you how to use k-means to cluster a csv
file containing numeric data.  The example is contained in the file:

	> `org/battelle/clodhopper/examples/kmeans/SimpleKMeansDemo.java`
	
This file is generously commented.
  
4. Also check out the following demos:

	> `org.battelle.clodhopper.examples.multiple.GeneratedDataPanel`

	This example runs several of the clustering algorithms in sequence on generated data. As they
	complete, it display scatter plots with the clusters collapsed into 2 dimensions.
	You can drag your mouse to select clusters and points in any of the plots and
	the selections propagate to the other plots, indicating how the clusters correspond.
	
	>  `org.battelle.clodhopper.examples.ui.ClodHopperUI`

	This example permits you to read in a csv data file and cluster the data using many
	of the algorithms in the library using just about any parameter setting you please.  Then you
	can save the clustering results in a simple csv file.
	
5. Watch for more on the wiki! ClodHopper is just getting started.
